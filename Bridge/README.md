# Bridge Pattern
**Bridge:** VehicleBridge <br/>
**Concrete bridge classes:** RedCar, BlackCar <br/>
**Abstract class:** Vehicle <br/>
**Concrete class:** Car <br/>

In this case, RedCar and BlackCar are not vehicles. <br/> 
However, via the Vehicle Bridge & Car, they are used like they are vehicles.
